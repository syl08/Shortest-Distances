/// This program can use as input:
/// 1.  Randomly generated points from the Cartesian plane
/// 2.  Points from the Cartesian plane read from a file (file name given as a command line argument)
///
/// The points are required to compute the edge weights between the vertices.
///
/// NOTES: The given code uses pointers to objects in most places.
